All prose passages quoted from Christopher Hailey, “Berg’s Worlds”, in
<i>Alban Berg and His World</i>, Princeton University Press (2010).
</p>
<h2 id="section">1</h2>
<p>Berg was a child of an age in which home libraries, the clutter of
treasured possessions, and the admonitory gaze of hallowed figures
peering down from walls or bookcases reflected a world of
interdependent,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvK4sCTOScE&list=PLa1rC97wRkZisGlMmkjPZqOPNPjf2vehY&index=7" target="_blank">overlapping</a>
social, cultural, and historical sureties. Berg’s social psyche was
predicated upon the pervasive imbrications of this collective order; his
moral compass was set by figures who challenged its authenticity.

<p>He himself was not a scintillating conversationalist, but was content
to sit listening in the background, a tendency exacerbated by his
physical self-consciousness. His height was an embarrassment in a world
of short men. Moreover, vain as he was, he spent a lifetime cultivating
a sensitive,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGuk-X15iks" target="_blank">sensuous</a>
mouth, whose half-closed lips concealed an awkward and silly gap between
his front teeth that undermined his studied likeness to Oscar Wilde. To
the acute awareness of his size and appearance were added a perception
of internal
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0CG0CmZ-GU" target="_blank">frailty</a>:
he had chronic bouts with asthma and was firm in his belief that his
heart was weak and undersized. (7)</p>

<p>If the “memory” of Vienna’s <i>Innenstadt</i> was the past on
display, a feast for the eye and the imagination upon the fullness of
time, there was in the <i>Vororte</i>, those districts beyond the outer
perimeter, a different kind of memory, less public, less constructed,
shot through with those little anachronisms from the living past that
anchor recall in the particularities of place. Here everyday experience
offered a refuge for memory under siege from those insistent
abstractions and agendas of modernity. Here those barriers of class,
culture, education, or generation so carefully cultivated in the
<i>Innenstadt</i> melted away in daily interactions in shops and
markets, on park benches or in trams, among neighbors, in social and
family circles, through myriad religious, cultural, or civic
affiliations. Compared to the outsized scale of the <i>Ringstrasse</i>,
the outer districts represented a parallel universe from another age,
still cut to
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNDX7-Qucg" target="_blank">human
dimensions</a> and flowing at a slower pace. (7–8)</p>

<p>Like so many of his Viennese contemporaries, Berg was obsessed with
the issue of social morality. He had absorbed the sexual theories of
Kraus, Freud, and Otto Weininger, and had read the works of Altenberg
and Arthur Schnitzler in which sexual hypocrisy and complex gender
relationships are constant preoccupations. It is a world that Berg knew
well, having fathered an illegitimate child with a servant girl at the
age of eighteen. Moreover, his sister was an outspoken lesbian and his
mother-in-law was once the emperor’s mistress. Berg loved the role of
confidant at the center of these <i>liaisons dangereuses</i>.</p>
<p>Berg’s capacity for excusing human foibles, his own and those of
others, reflects the moral largesse of an avowed sensualist. This is
readily apparent in his attention to his appearance and dress, as well
as his tastes in food and drink, art and literature. In his youth his
favorite painting was Correggio’s highly charged <i>Jupiter and Juno</i>
[<i>recte</i> <i>Io</i>] and throughout his life he retained an
aesthete’s tactile delight in handicrafts and graphic design, for which
he himself showed a decided flair. This is not to say he did not love
technology and modern gadgets. He went regularly to the cinema, was
inordinately pleased with his first typewriter, listened with delight to
the radio and the phonograph, and took childlike glee in owning his own
automobile. But he was devoted to the refined sensibilities of another
age, to the aesthetic pleasure and meticulous pride one takes in

<p>The gravitational pull of [Berg’s] music reflects a weariness that
could never rouse itself to the kind of breakthrough one finds in the
finale of a Mahler symphony, a weariness that has never known the
bristling, jittery energy of a Schoenberg quartet. Mahler and Schoenberg
likewise knew states of weariness—in <i>Das Lied von der Erde</i> or
<i>Gurrelieder</i>, for instance—but it is the weariness born of a long,
hard journey. These are composers whose music is of a piece with their
restless worldly wanderings across cultures and continents. Berg,
however, was no seeker of adventure, but a creature of habit who
preferred a settled life. One is struck by the contrast between the
serenity of Berg’s Trahütten idyll and the raw emotion of his opera
[<i>Wozzeck</i>], but in this country environment Berg held both worlds,
the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA8icO3nWIw" target="_blank">vistas</a>
and the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds-777HS0ME" target="_blank">abyss</a>,
within himself. (14)</p>

<p>[I]t was less Berg’s harmonic language [in <i>Wozzeck</i>] than his
use of closed vocal and instrumental forms to
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44V0u6YU2hU" target="_blank">shape</a>
his scenes and acts that caused the most immediate stir, provoking
comparisons with such works as Busoni’s <i>Doktor Faust</i> and
Hindemith’s <i>Cardillac</i>. And it is this aspect that Berg himself,
for varied and complex reasons, would continue to emphasize—almost to
the exclusion of all else—in his articles and lectures on the opera. It
was in part a strategy to undercut his growing reputation as a
“Romantic,” just as his elaborately constructed serial relationships
would later
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEjVr3Y3yOQ" target="_blank">serve</a>
to offset his music’s pervasive references to tonality. (17)</p>

<p>[Berg] avoided overt engagement with politics or issues of social
justice. His sympathies with Red Vienna, the Socialist regime that
governed the city during the 1920s and early 1930s, had more to do with
personal loyalties and the largesse of its progressively minded cultural
policies, of which he was a beneficiary. Before 1918 he had been a
monarchist, and following the brutal civil strife of 1934 he became a
committed supporter of the Austrofascism of Dollfuss and Schuschnigg.
However, as a disciple of Kraus he maintained his right to an
oppositional stance—on principle—which was easy enough from the privacy
of his study in Hietzing. (19–20)</p>

<p>Berg was fully aware of the racial policies of National Socialism. He
had already seen its consequences for Schoenberg and Schreker and
received heartrending letters from Jewish friends and colleagues such as
Jalowetz, who faced summary dismissal from his conducting position in
Cologne. Yet at no time could he bring himself to take a public stand
against anti-Semitism… It is anybody’s guess how Berg might have
responded to the events of 1938. He would never have lapsed into
Webern’s naïve patriotic jingoism, but it is highly unlikely that this
deeply rooted <i>Lokalpatriot</i> would have chosen exile or resistance.
(22–23)</p>

<p>Berg himself, like his protagonist Lulu, was an enigma to those who
knew him, or, rather, he was

things to all people</a>. (24)</p>

<p>Part of the hagiographic tone of much of the writing about Berg
springs from a desire to bask in the glow of the “magic of his being.”
He was no doubt gentle, kind, and caring, and countless letters and
drafts bear witness to his solicitous sense of
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOYqM91nzmM" target="_blank">occasion</a>
for a birthday, an anniversary, a death. But there is always something
<i>unverbindlich</i>, noncommittal, about his sincerely expressed
concern, a politeness that is a form of self-protection, a surface
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZpTWf2yhbQ" target="_blank">geniality</a>
that bespeaks a profound
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLZvY92QNJE" target="_blank">reserve</a>.
Adorno said as much when he called Berg the “foreign minister of the
land of his dreams” [<i>der Außenminister seines Traumlands</i>].

<p>Berg was keen in his indictment of society’s hypocrisy, which
concerned him far more than its injustice, but the true object of his
concern was himself… In approaching these subjects of depravity and
decay, Berg never abandons the vantage point of bourgeois moral
privilege. Through careful dramaturgy and lavish compositional detail he
invites his audience to view this world through the prism of high art.
His is an empathy that at its deepest level bespeaks self-love and
satisfaction with its own
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soR-6jrN8_s" target="_blank">moral
righteousness</a>. This is why both operas, despite their subject
matter, have entered so comfortably into the repertoire in a way that
the far more radical works by Schreker have not. Schreker’s music
eschews the comforts of “high art” and keeps its bourgeois audience off
balance in a manner that oddly adumbrates the distancing effects of
Brecht and Weill. (25)</p>

<p>Austria’s literary impressionists, including Schnitzler, Hugo von
Hofmannsthal, and especially Hermann Bahr, who were entirely attuned to
the notion of modernity that Baudelaire had described as early as 1863
as
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYk-t8IbYK8" target="_blank">“the
fleeting, the ephemeral, the contingent.”</a> It is the concept of a
self that is wholly subject to time.</p>
<p>Everything in Berg revolted against this notion—his settled habits
and sedentary life, his gravitation toward fixed compass points (though
not of settled morality), his belief in overarching controlling forces,
from numerological patterns to the alignment of the stars. He was a man
of obsessive preoccupations with the hoarding instincts of a pack rat.
Ironically, Berg read and set Baudelaire’s texts in <i>Der Wein</i>, but
in his understanding time was not so much “fleeting,” “ephemeral,” or
“contingent” as viscous, tactile, and
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruKXhtufaSg&list=OLAK5uy_kA6807JYSztXAymSWLIdwiJl2eHVmNq80&index=3" target="_blank">even</a>

<p>Contradiction and paradox are central ingredients of Berg’s persona
and of his music. He was a man of open amiability and of many
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRl3AKbhek&list=PLa9mbbbef6noUwFIqC626lho_YlhKkvwF&index=6" target="_blank">secrets</a>;
a faithful friend and an eager consumer of malicious gossip; a composer
of fierce modernism who courted popular appeal. The elusive qualities of
his character make it easy to be sucked into a vortex of eternal regress
and self-absorption. Berg, the man, we follow at our peril. Berg, the
composer, however,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huZjbMQkW6I" target="_blank">transformed</a>
the spinning vortex of his unknowable self into extraordinary music that
reaches beyond the self toward a common understanding of the human
condition. (28)</p>
