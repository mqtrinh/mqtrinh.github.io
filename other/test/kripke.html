<h1 id="kripkes-concept-of-reference">Kripke’s Concept of Reference</h1>
<p><i>3 March 2014</i></p>
<h2 id="section"></h2>
<p>In this exposition, we review Kripke’s argument in “Speaker’s Reference and Semantic Reference” that Donnellan’s paper “Reference and Definite Descriptions” fails as a critique of Russell’s theory of definite descriptions. Kripke’s main idea is a thought-experiment: We imagine languages that, by stipulation, assign truth-values to their sentences in accordance with either Russell’s or Donnellan’s theory to varying degrees. Finding that the issues raised by Donnellan still hold for the invented Russell languages, Kripke concludes that Donnellan’s assertions are insufficient to prove that English is not a Russell language. By contrasting the “unitarity” of the Russell languages with the ambiguity of what he calls the “ambiguous D-language,” Kripke suggests that English more closely resembles the former than the latter.</p>
<p>First, let us summarize Donnellan’s work. He claims that Russell’s paper “On Denoting” fails to address a specific use of definite descriptions, which he will call the referential use. Donnellan distinguishes sentences in which the referent is an abstraction defined solely by the speaker’s description, and sentences in which the speaker is referring to a person or thing that her audience can pick out from the context of the linguistic performance. The first case is called the <i>attributive use</i> and the second case is called the <i>referential use</i>. For example, consider, “Smith’s murderer is insane,” as spoken by a juror in a courtroom. If “Smith’s murderer” is used attributively, then the juror means the unique individual who committed Smith’s murder, presupposing this individual exists. If the definite description is used referentially with respect to a defendant Jones, then the subject of the sentence is Jones, not Smith’s actual murderer, which we must understand in the context of the juror’s implicit belief that Jones <i>is</i> Smith’s murderer. (It remains possible for the juror to employ the attributive use while believing that Jones committed Smith’s murder.) Even if Jones is not actually the murderer, i.e., the speaker’s beliefs are <i>mistaken</i>, it may still be true that Jones is insane, in which case this usage still expresses a truth about the juror’s world. By contrast, Russell’s theory holds that every sentence using a definite description is equivalent to a “completely general [logical] proposition,” so that “Smith’s murderer” means “The one and only individual that murdered Smith,” the meaning of its attributive use. Going further, Donnellan argues that what Russell called “genuine” proper names are referential uses of definite descriptions. Russellian definite descriptions denote things only insofar as they fulfill the description. Russellian proper names aim to denote something without “ascribing any properties to it,” in the same way that a referential use of a definite description is a mere linguistic device, whose ability to refer is “not simply a function of its fitting the description.”</p>
<p>For Kripke, Donnellan’s attributive-referential distinction advances a semantic ambiguity, despite the latter’s claim that the ambiguity is neither syntactic nor semantic, but pragmatic. Kripke says that the distinction cannot be pragmatic, because we can preserve it when reporting accurately upon the statements of other speakers, which does not require us to engage in the same speech acts or possess the same intentions as our source. Thus, he deduces, Donnellan’s “attributive” and “referential” are not <i>uses,</i> but <i>senses</i>, of a definite description. To demonstrate the real ambiguity, Kripke considers the sentence, “Her husband is kind to her,” uttered by a speaker who falsely believes that the lover of a given woman is her husband. Were Donnellan asked, “Is this statement true?”, he would need to identify the sense of the definite description in the original statement as either attributive or referential. The former “misrepresents” the linguistic performance. The latter, assuming Donnellan knew the truth about the lover, would misrepresent the referent when reported by him, unless qualified, because to him, “Her husband” means the husband, not the lover. So Donnellan is unable to answer with an unambiguous truth value. Kripke concludes: All Donnellan’s theory can assert is that “a speaker can refer to the lover and say, of him, that he is kind to her” by using the original sentence. Nor has Donnellan convincingly defended himself against the charge of semantic ambiguity.</p>
<p>Before proceeding to imaginary languages, Kripke introduces a new distinction between referents of a designator, which is not a mere extension to the attributive-referential distinction. The <i>semantic referent</i> of a designator is the object determined by the semantic conventions of language: In the case of definite descriptions, it coincides with Russell’s notion of referent. The <i>speaker’s referent</i> is the object the speaker <i>believes</i> to fulfill the conditions to be the semantic referent. Kripke also distinguishes <i>general intention</i> that determines semantic referent from <i>specific intention</i> that determines speaker’s referent. (In the case of an existential quantification, the thing receiving quantification, whether or not the existential statement is true, is the speaker’s referent.) Having shown that Donnellan’s distinction is one of sense, not use, he proposes that Donnellan’s attributive sense is the “simple” case where the specific intention does refer to the semantic referent, and that the referential sense is the “complex” case where the specific intention and general intention differ, but the speaker <i>believes</i> the referents to coincide.</p>
<p>
With this setup, Kripke aims to show Donnellan’s analysis is insufficiently strong to counter Russell, using the following “razor”:
</p>
<div class="quote">
<p>If someone alleges that a certain linguistic phenomenon in English is a counterexample to a given analysis, consider a hypothetical language which (as much as possible) is like English except that we <i>stipulate</i> [italics added] the analysis to be correct (265).</p>
</div>
<p>
To portray Russell’s position, he posits three languages as follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
The <i>weak Russell language</i> is identical to English except the truth conditions of sentences containing definite descriptions are stipulated to be those of Russell’s theory. For Kripke, this means every definite description is a primitive designator that receives its semantic referent, which we stipulate to be the unique object satisfying the description; else it does not refer.
</li>
<li>
The <i>intermediate Russell language</i> is identical to English, except every definite description is an abbreviation for its Russellian deep-structure analysis as a logical proposition.
</li>
<li>
The <i>strong Russell language</i> is identical to the intermediate one, but we <i>ban</i> definite descriptions and make all deep-structure substitutions.
</li>
</ol>
<p>Against these, we contrast two “D-languages”:</p>
<ol>
<li>
The unambiguous D-language has words “the” and “ze,” where “…the <span class="math inline"><em>F</em></span>…” is true if and only if the predicate is true of the unique object fulfilling <span class="math inline"><em>F</em></span>, and “…ze <span class="math inline"><em>F</em></span>…” is true if and only if the predicate is true of the unique object of which the speaker <i>believes</i> <span class="math inline"><em>F</em></span> to be true.
</li>
<li>
The ambiguous D-language is identical to the unambiguous one, except “the” now plays the roles of both “the” and “ze.”
</li>
</ol>
<p>By construction, the two articles in the unambiguous D-language correspond to Donnellan’s attributive and referential senses, respectively. Therefore, Donnellan’s proposal is equivalent to claiming English is less like any of the Russell languages, and more like the ambiguous D-language. However, Kripke find that the simple case-complex case distinction described earlier remains present in all of the Russell languages, assuming its speakers are as fallible as English speakers. Since this distinction is equivalent to the attributive-referential distinction, Donnellan has given “no argument that English is not a Russell language.”</p>
<p>As yet, we have not disproven the possibility that English is closer to ambiguous D. Here, Kripke argues that the existence of ambiguities in a theory of language is “lazy.” If a word really has two senses, then we should be able to posit languages in which separate words denote the two senses, and we can even search empirically for such examples. The implausibility or nonexistence of such a separation indicates, for Kripke, that a “unitary account” is preferable. The semantic referent-speaker’s referent distinction remains as plausible in the invented Russell languages as in English, and in fact, this distinction extends to the theory of proper names, not just definite descriptions; by contrast, the “separate referential sense” of the article “the” in ambiguous D seems localized, artificial, and inelegant: an “idle wheel that does no work.” Most compellingly, Kripke considers two possible responses to “Her husband is kind to her” in English:</p>
<ol>
<li>
“He is kind to her, but isn’t her husband.”
<li>
“No he isn’t. The man to whom you’re referring isn’t her husband.”
</ol>
<p>(Both speakers know that the lover is truly kind.) Assume English is ambiguous D, so that Donnellan’s theory applies. Since the original speaker was speaking referentially, the lover was both the semantic referent and speaker’s referent of “Her husband” in the original sentence. In (1), “he” refers to this person, and there is no problem. In (2), “he” cannot refer to the actual husband unless the second speaker believes the first speaker was employing the attributive use, which we rule out from the next part of the second speaker’s utterance. But if it refers to the lover, then the second speaker contradicts his belief that the lover is kind. Thus, our assumption that English is ambiguous D is problematic.</p>
