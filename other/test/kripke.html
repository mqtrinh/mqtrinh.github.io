<p><i>3 March 2014</i></p>
<h2 id="section"></h2>
<p>In this exposition, we review Kripke’s argument in “Speaker’s
Reference and Semantic Reference” that Donnellan’s paper “Reference and
Definite Descriptions” fails as a critique of Russell’s theory of
definite descriptions. Kripke’s main idea is a thought-experiment: We
imagine languages that, by stipulation, assign truth-values to their
sentences in accordance with either Russell’s or Donnellan’s theory to
varying degrees. Finding that the issues raised by Donnellan still hold
for the invented Russell languages, Kripke concludes that Donnellan’s
assertions are insufficient to prove that English is not a Russell
language. By contrasting the “unitarity” of the Russell languages with
the ambiguity of what he calls the “ambiguous D-language,” Kripke
suggests that English more closely resembles the former than the
latter.</p>
<p>First, let us summarize Donnellan’s work. He claims that Russell’s
paper “On Denoting” fails to address a specific use of definite
descriptions, which he will call the referential use. Donnellan
distinguishes sentences in which the referent is an abstraction defined
solely by the speaker’s description, and sentences in which the speaker
is referring to a person or thing that her audience can pick out from
the context of the linguistic performance. The first case is called the
<i>attributive use</i> and the second case is called the <i>referential
use</i>. For example, consider, “Smith’s murderer is insane,” as spoken
by a juror in a courtroom. If “Smith’s murderer” is used attributively,
then the juror means the unique individual who committed Smith’s murder,
presupposing this individual exists. If the definite description is used
referentially with respect to a defendant Jones, then the subject of the
sentence is Jones, not Smith’s actual murderer, which we must understand
in the context of the juror’s implicit belief that Jones <i>is</i>
Smith’s murderer. (It remains possible for the juror to employ the
attributive use while believing that Jones committed Smith’s murder.)
Even if Jones is not actually the murderer, i.e., the speaker’s beliefs
are <i>mistaken</i>, it may still be true that Jones is insane, in which
case this usage still expresses a truth about the juror’s world. By
contrast, Russell’s theory holds that every sentence using a definite
description is equivalent to a “completely general [logical]
proposition,” so that “Smith’s murderer” means “The one and only
individual that murdered Smith,” the meaning of its attributive use.
Going further, Donnellan argues that what Russell called “genuine”
proper names are referential uses of definite descriptions. Russellian
definite descriptions denote things only insofar as they fulfill the
description. Russellian proper names aim to denote something without
“ascribing any properties to it,” in the same way that a referential use
of a definite description is a mere linguistic device, whose ability to
refer is “not simply a function of its fitting the description.”</p>
<p>For Kripke, Donnellan’s attributive-referential distinction advances
a semantic ambiguity, despite the latter’s claim that the ambiguity is
neither syntactic nor semantic, but pragmatic. Kripke says that the
distinction cannot be pragmatic, because we can preserve it when
reporting accurately upon the statements of other speakers, which does
not require us to engage in the same speech acts or possess the same
intentions as our source. Thus, he deduces, Donnellan’s “attributive”
and “referential” are not <i>uses,</i> but <i>senses</i>, of a definite
description. To demonstrate the real ambiguity, Kripke considers the
sentence, “Her husband is kind to her,” uttered by a speaker who falsely
believes that the lover of a given woman is her husband. Were Donnellan
asked, “Is this statement true?”, he would need to identify the sense of
the definite description in the original statement as either attributive
or referential. The former “misrepresents” the linguistic performance.
The latter, assuming Donnellan knew the truth about the lover, would
misrepresent the referent when reported by him, unless qualified,
because to him, “Her husband” means the husband, not the lover. So
Donnellan is unable to answer with an unambiguous truth value. Kripke
concludes: All Donnellan’s theory can assert is that “a speaker can
refer to the lover and say, of him, that he is kind to her” by using the
original sentence. Nor has Donnellan convincingly defended himself
against the charge of semantic ambiguity.</p>
<p>Before proceeding to imaginary languages, Kripke introduces a new
distinction between referents of a designator, which is not a mere
extension to the attributive-referential distinction. The <i>semantic
referent</i> of a designator is the object determined by the semantic
conventions of language: In the case of definite descriptions, it
coincides with Russell’s notion of referent. The <i>speaker’s
referent</i> is the object the speaker <i>believes</i> to fulfill the
conditions to be the semantic referent. Kripke also distinguishes
<i>general intention</i> that determines semantic referent from
<i>specific intention</i> that determines speaker’s referent. (In the
case of an existential quantification, the thing receiving
quantification, whether or not the existential statement is true, is the
speaker’s referent.) Having shown that Donnellan’s distinction is one of
sense, not use, he proposes that Donnellan’s attributive sense is the
“simple” case where the specific intention does refer to the semantic
referent, and that the referential sense is the “complex” case where the
specific intention and general intention differ, but the speaker
<i>believes</i> the referents to coincide.</p>
<p>
With this setup, Kripke aims to show Donnellan’s analysis is
insufficiently strong to counter Russell, using the following “razor”:
</p>
<div class="quote">
<p>If someone alleges that a certain linguistic phenomenon in English is
a counterexample to a given analysis, consider a hypothetical language
which (as much as possible) is like English except that we
<i>stipulate</i> [italics added] the analysis to be correct (265).</p>
</div>
<p>
To portray Russell’s position, he posits three languages as follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
The <i>weak Russell language</i> is identical to English except the
truth conditions of sentences containing definite descriptions are
stipulated to be those of Russell’s theory. For Kripke, this means every
definite description is a primitive designator that receives its
semantic referent, which we stipulate to be the unique object satisfying
the description; else it does not refer.
</li>
<li>
The <i>intermediate Russell language</i> is identical to English, except
every definite description is an abbreviation for its Russellian
deep-structure analysis as a logical proposition.
</li>
<li>
The <i>strong Russell language</i> is identical to the intermediate one,
but we <i>ban</i> definite descriptions and make all deep-structure
substitutions.
</li>
</ol>
<p>Against these, we contrast two “D-languages”:</p>
<ol>
<li>
The unambiguous D-language has words “the” and “ze,” where “…the <span
class="math inline"><em>F</em></span>…” is true if and only if the
predicate is true of the unique object fulfilling <span
class="math inline"><em>F</em></span>, and “…ze <span
class="math inline"><em>F</em></span>…” is true if and only if the
predicate is true of the unique object of which the speaker
<i>believes</i> <span class="math inline"><em>F</em></span> to be true.
</li>
<li>
The ambiguous D-language is identical to the unambiguous one, except
“the” now plays the roles of both “the” and “ze.”
</li>
</ol>
<p>By construction, the two articles in the unambiguous D-language
correspond to Donnellan’s attributive and referential senses,
respectively. Therefore, Donnellan’s proposal is equivalent to claiming
English is less like any of the Russell languages, and more like the
ambiguous D-language. However, Kripke find that the simple case-complex
case distinction described earlier remains present in all of the Russell
languages, assuming its speakers are as fallible as English speakers.
Since this distinction is equivalent to the attributive-referential
distinction, Donnellan has given “no argument that English is not a
Russell language.”</p>
<p>As yet, we have not disproven the possibility that English is closer
to ambiguous D. Here, Kripke argues that the existence of ambiguities in
a theory of language is “lazy.” If a word really has two senses, then we
should be able to posit languages in which separate words denote the two
senses, and we can even search empirically for such examples. The
implausibility or nonexistence of such a separation indicates, for
Kripke, that a “unitary account” is preferable. The semantic
referent-speaker’s referent distinction remains as plausible in the
invented Russell languages as in English, and in fact, this distinction
extends to the theory of proper names, not just definite descriptions;
by contrast, the “separate referential sense” of the article “the” in
ambiguous D seems localized, artificial, and inelegant: an “idle wheel
that does no work.” Most compellingly, Kripke considers two possible
responses to “Her husband is kind to her” in English:</p>
<ol>
<li>
“He is kind to her, but isn’t her husband.”
<li>
“No he isn’t. The man to whom you’re referring isn’t her husband.”
</ol>
<p>(Both speakers know that the lover is truly kind.) Assume English is
ambiguous D, so that Donnellan’s theory applies. Since the original
speaker was speaking referentially, the lover was both the semantic
referent and speaker’s referent of “Her husband” in the original
sentence. In (1), “he” refers to this person, and there is no problem.
In (2), “he” cannot refer to the actual husband unless the second
speaker believes the first speaker was employing the attributive use,
which we rule out from the next part of the second speaker’s utterance.
But if it refers to the lover, then the second speaker contradicts his
belief that the lover is kind. Thus, our assumption that English is
ambiguous D is problematic.</p>
