<p>Homework is assigned in two ways: by problem set and over
<a href="https://lms.mitx.mit.edu/" target="_blank">MITx</a>. In
addition to exams and homework, there is a participation grade, so I’ll
be taking attendance at recitation.</p>
<p>I will use this webpage to record what we discuss.</p>
<h2 id="section">21-10-20</h2>
<p>
Review for the final exam.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Discuss how to approximate <span
class="math inline">\(\cos(0.51\pi)\)</span>. Instead of approximating
<span class="math inline">\(\cos x\)</span> near <span
class="math inline">\(x = 0\)</span>, this problem calls for
approximating it near <span class="math inline">\(x = 0.5\pi\)</span>.
</li>
<li>
For radius-of-convergence problems, my general advice is to study the
official solution to Problem 8 of Practice Final Exam #1. I was teaching
a slightly different method earlier, but this method helps us avoid
pitfalls when the terms of the series involve <span
class="math inline">\(x^{2n}\)</span> (or <span
class="math inline">\(x^{2n - 1}\)</span>, <i>etc.</i>) rather than
<span class="math inline">\(x^n\)</span>. For reinforcement, I’ve
updated some other examples on this webpage.
</li>
<li>
Sanity check: The radius of convergence of <span
class="math inline">\(\sum_{n = 0}^\infty 2^n x^n\)</span> equals <span
class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span>, not <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span>.
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="section-1">21-10-18</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Discuss how to rescale functions. The graph of <span
class="math inline">\(y = (1/3)f(x)\)</span> is three times shorter than
the graph of <span class="math inline">\(y = f(x)\)</span>. The graph of
<span class="math inline">\(y = f(x/3)\)</span> is three times
<i>wider</i> than the graph of <span class="math inline">\(y =
f(x)\)</span>.
</li>
<li>
Let <span class="math inline">\(\Psi_{\mu, \sigma}(x_0)\)</span> be the
probability that a normal variable with mean <span
class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and standard deviation <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> takes a value less than <span
class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span>. When the mean is <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and the standard deviation is <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, we have the formula <span
class="math display">\[\Psi_{0, 1}(t_0) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}
\int_0^{t_0} e^{-\tfrac{1}{2}t^2}\,dt.\]</span> If we rescale the
standard deviation from <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>, then we should rescale the
integrand so that its graph is wider by a factor of <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>, while keeping the total area
under the graph equal to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. So by
the scaling principle above, we should substitute <span
class="math inline">\(t = u/\sigma\)</span> , giving <span
class="math display">\[\Psi_{0, \sigma}(u_0) =
\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_0^{u_0}
e^{-\tfrac{1}{2}(\tfrac{u}{\sigma})^2}\,du.\]</span> If we shift the
mean from <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>, then we should substitute <span
class="math inline">\(u = x - \mu\)</span>, giving <span
class="math display">\[\Psi_{\mu, \sigma}(x_0) =
\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_0^{x_0}
e^{-\tfrac{1}{2}(\tfrac{x - \mu}{\sigma})^2}\,dx.\]</span> This is the
most general formula.
</li>
<li>
In practice, you might be given a table of values for <span
class="math inline">\(\Psi_{0, 1}\)</span>. To match them up with the
values of <span class="math inline">\(\Psi_{\mu, \sigma}\)</span>, use
<span class="math display">\[\Psi_{\mu, \sigma}(x) = \Psi_{0,
1}(\tfrac{x - \mu}{\sigma}).\]</span> (As a sanity check: <span
class="math inline">\(\Psi_{\mu, \sigma}(\mu) = \Psi_{0, 1}(0) =
0.5\)</span>.) Another useful formula is <span
class="math display">\[\Psi_{0, 1}(-t) = 1 - \Psi_{0, 1}(t),\]</span> a
consequence of the symmetry of the normal distribution.
</li>
<li>
If the lifespan of a flashlight battery is a normal variable with mean
<span class="math inline">\(120\)</span> hours and standard deviation
<span class="math inline">\(36\)</span> hours, what is the probability
that its lifespan is between <span class="math inline">\(85\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(135\)</span> hours? Write <span
class="math display">\[\mathbf{P}(85 &lt; \text{lifespan} &lt; 135) =
\Psi_{120, 36}(135) - \Psi_{120, 36}(85).\]</span> We compute <span
class="math inline">\((85 - 120)/36 \approx -1.0\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\((135 - 120)/36 \approx 0.4\)</span>, so the last
expression equals <span class="math display">\[\Psi_{0, 1}(0.4) -
\Psi_{0, 1}(-1.0)
= \Psi_{0, 1}(0.4) - (1 - \Psi_{0, 1}(1.0)) \approx 0.66 - (1 - 0.84) =
0.50.\]</span> That is, the probability we want is <span
class="math inline">\(\approx 50\%\)</span>.
</li>
<li>
Suppose that in a certain course, grades follow a normal distribution
with mean <span class="math inline">\(70\)</span> and standard deviation
<span class="math inline">\(10\)</span>. If the professor wants <span
class="math inline">\(90\%\)</span> of students to pass, what should be
the cutoff for a passing grade? Let <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> be the desired cutoff. Then <span
class="math display">\[\mathbf{P}(\text{grade} \geq x) = 1 -
\mathbf{P}(\text{grade} &lt; x) = 1 - \Psi_{70, 10}(x).\]</span> We can
check from a table that <span class="math inline">\(1 - \Psi_{0,
1}(-1.3) = \Psi_{0, 1}(1.3) = 0.9\)</span>, so we want <span
class="math display">\[\Psi_{70, 10}(x) = \Psi_{0, 1}(-1.3).\]</span> By
our earlier substitution formula, we deduce that <span
class="math inline">\(-1.3 = (x - 70)/10\)</span>, giving <span
class="math inline">\(x = 57\)</span>.
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="section-2">21-10-13</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Discuss problem 1(c) on problem set 4. To find the series expansion of
the function <span class="math inline">\(y(x)\)</span> that satisfies
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
y&#39; &amp;= -xy,\\
y(0) &amp;= 1,
\end{align}\]</span> suppose <span class="math inline">\(y = \sum_{n =
0}^\infty a_n x^n\)</span>. Then we can express <span
class="math inline">\(y&#39;\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(-xy\)</span> in terms of similar series. Equating
these series, we obtain a recursion relation among the <span
class="math inline">\(a_n\)</span>, which we can solve using the initial
condition <span class="math inline">\(y(0) = 1\)</span>.
</li>
<li>
To find the radius of convergence of the series <span
class="math display">\[x - \frac{x^3}{3} + \frac{x^5}{5} - \frac{x^7}{7}
+ \cdots\]</span> the fastest method is to use the “ratio test”. If you
write the series in the form <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{n =
1}^\infty a_n x^n\)</span>, then: <span class="math display">\[a_n =
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
\dfrac{(-1)^{(n - 1)/2}}{n} &amp;\text{$n$ odd}\\
0 &amp;\text{$m$ even}
\end{array}\right.\]</span> By the ratio test, the series converges for
<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> such that <span
class="math display">\[\lim_{n \to \infty} \left|\frac{a_{n + 2} x^{n +
2}}{a_n x^n}\right| \leq 1.\]</span> The limit simplifies to <span
class="math inline">\(|x|^2\)</span>, so the radius of convergence is
<span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. Indeed, this series converges to
<span class="math inline">\(\arctan x\)</span> within the interval <span
class="math inline">\(-1 &lt; x &lt; 1\)</span>, but diverges outside
that interval!
</li>
<li>
Once we know the radius of convergence of some series <span
class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>, we can also find the answer for,
say, <span class="math inline">\(\int_0^x f(t)\,dt\)</span>. Taking
<span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> to be the series in the
previous example, <span class="math display">\[\int_0^x f(t)\,dt =
\sum_{n = 2}^\infty b_n x^n\]</span> with the coefficients <span
class="math display">\[b_n = \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
\dfrac{(-1)^{n/2 + 1}}{n(n - 1)} &amp;\text{$n$ even}\\
0 &amp;\text{$n$ odd}
\end{array}\right.
\]</span> This has the same radius of convergence.
</li>
<li>
You can also solve the problem above using the <span
class="math inline">\(\limsup\)</span> formula. We have <span
class="math inline">\((1/(n(n - 1)))^{1/n} \approx n^{-2/n} \to
1\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(n \to \infty\)</span>, from
which <span class="math display">\[\limsup_{n \to \infty}
\sqrt[n]{|b_n|} = \limsup_{n \to \infty} \left(\frac{1}{n(n -
1)}\right)^{1/n} = 1.\]</span> We again get the radius of convergence
<span class="math inline">\(1/1 = 1\)</span>.
</li>
<li>
Review the Poisson random variable of parameter <span
class="math inline">\(\mu &gt; 0\)</span>: Its domain is the set of
nonnegative integers, and its probability function <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{P}(X)\)</span> is given by <span
class="math display">\[\mathbf{P}(X = k) =
e^{-\mu}\frac{\mu^k}{k!}.\]</span> Fun to check that <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}(X) = \mu\)</span>.
</li>
<li>
If the number of orders per hour in a restaurant is Poisson with mean
<span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>, then what’s the likelihood that
there will be at least <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> orders in
a given hour? Write: <span class="math display">\[\mathbf{P}(X \geq 3) =
1 - \sum_{k = 0, 1, 2} \mathbf{P}(X = k) = 1 - \sum_{k = 0, 1,
2}  e^{-5}\frac{5^k}{k!} = 1 - \frac{37}{2}e^{-5}.\]</span> This is
roughly an <span class="math inline">\(87.5\%\)</span> chance.
</li>
<li>
Suppose that a number generator outputs the positive integer <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> with probability <span
class="math inline">\(1/2^n\)</span>. What’s the probability that the
output is divisible by <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>?
Calculate: <span class="math display">\[\sum_{k = 1}^\infty \mathbf{P}(n
= 3k) = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{2^{3k}}.\]</span> This is a
geometric series with starting term <span class="math inline">\(a =
1/8\)</span> and ratio <span class="math inline">\(r = 1/8\)</span>
between consecutive terms, so the answer is <span
class="math inline">\(a/(1 - r) = 1/7\)</span>.
</li>
<li>

paradox</a>.

</ul>
<div class="p">
More examples of radius of convergence:
<ul>
<li>
To find the radius of <span class="math display">\[\sum_{n = 1}^\infty
\frac{100^n}{n!} x^{2n - 1},\]</span> we want to find the <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-interval where <span
class="math display">\[\lim_{m \to \infty} \left|\frac{100^{(n + 1)}
x^{2(n + 1) - 1}/(n + 1)!}{100^n x^n/n!}\right| \leq 1.\]</span> The
limit simplifies to <span class="math inline">\(\lim_{n \to \infty} 100
|x|^2/(n + 1) = 0\)</span>, so any <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> will work, meaning the radius of
convergence is infinite.
</li>
<li>
To find the radius of <span class="math display">\[\log\left(1 +
\frac{x^2}{2}\right),\]</span> we rely on a Taylor series we already
know: <span class="math display">\[\log\left(1 + \frac{x^2}{2}\right) =
\frac{x^2}{1\cdot 2} - \frac{x^4}{2 \cdot 2^2} + \frac{x^6}{3 \cdot 2^3}
- \cdots\]</span> After dividing by <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, we arrive at a series <span
class="math inline">\(\sum_{m = 2}^\infty a_m x^m\)</span> in which
<span class="math display">\[a_m = \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
\dfrac{(-1)^{n + 1}}{n \cdot 2^n} &amp;\text{$m = 2n$}\\
0 &amp;\text{$m$ odd}
\end{array}\right.
\]</span> Check for yourself that the radius of convergence is <span
class="math inline">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span>. But note!—the original function
is not defined at the central point <span class="math inline">\(x =
0\)</span>. We say that it has a <i>removable singularity</i> there.

<li>
Discuss problem 4(a) on problem set 3, which asks for the “general
properties of integrals” used to establish certain inequalities. For the
first two inequalities, the answers should be conditionals of the form,
“If [<i>condition</i>], then [<i>inequality</i>]”, stated in terms of a
more general integrand. For the third inequality, the answer is the
theorem that makes it possible to compute the integral at all.

Finish discussing the <span class="math inline">\(\int_0^1 (\ln
x)^2\,dx\)</span> example from Monday.
</li>
<li>
To study the convergence of the series <span
class="math display">\[\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \tan \frac{1}{n},\]</span>
note that <span class="math inline">\(1/n \to 0^+\)</span> as <span
class="math inline">\(n \to \infty\)</span>, and thus <span
class="math inline">\(\tan(1/n) \approx 1/n\)</span> for <span
class="math inline">\(n \gg 0\)</span>. So the series is approximated by
the harmonic series <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{n = 1}^\infty
1/n\)</span>, which diverges.
</li>
<li>
To study the convergence of the series <span
class="math display">\[\sum_{n = 2}^\infty \frac{1}{n \ln n},\]</span>
note that it’s larger than the integral <span
class="math inline">\(\int_2^\infty (1/(x \ln x))\,dx\)</span>. Setting
<span class="math inline">\(u = \ln x\)</span>, this integral equals
<span class="math inline">\(\int_{\ln 2}^\infty (1/u)\,du\)</span>,
which diverges.
</li>
<li>
To study the convergence of the series <span
class="math display">\[\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{n!}{n^n},\]</span> one
approach would be to use Stirling’s asymptotic <span
class="math inline">\(n! \sim \sqrt{2\pi n}(n/e)^n\)</span>. (We write
<span class="math inline">\(A(x) \sim B(x)\)</span> to mean <span
class="math inline">\(\lim_{x \to \infty} A/B = 1\)</span>.) A simpler
approach that several people offered: Observe that <span
class="math display">\[n \geq 4 \implies \frac{n!}{n^n} = \frac{(1 \cdot
2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5 \cdots n)}{(n \cdot n \cdot n) \cdot (n
\cdot n \cdots n)} \leq \frac{1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3}{n \cdot n \cdot n} =
\frac{6}{n^3}.\]</span> The series <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{n =
4}^\infty 6/n^3\)</span> converges by the <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-test, so the original series does by
comparison.
</li>
<li>
A <i>power series</i> (centered at <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span>) is a series of the form <span
class="math inline">\(\sum_{n = 0}^\infty a_n x^n\)</span> where the
<span class="math inline">\(a_n\)</span> are constants. It converges
whenever <span class="math inline">\(|x|\)</span> is strictly less than
the <i>radius of convergence</i> <span
class="math display">\[\frac{1}{\limsup_{n \to \infty}
\sqrt[n]{|a_n|}}.\]</span> When <span class="math inline">\(|x|\)</span>
equals the radius itself, the series could either converge or diverge.
<i>Note:</i> Later, we’ll discuss a faster way to calculate this radius.
</li>
<li>
Above, <span class="math inline">\(\limsup\)</span> is short for
<i>limit supremum</i> and defined by <span
class="math display">\[\limsup_{n \to \infty} f(n) = \lim_{N \to \infty}
\max_{n \geq N} f(n).\]</span> (In recitation, I gave a wrong
definition.)
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_inferior_and_limit_superior#/media/File:Lim_sup_example_5.png" target="_blank">This
illustration</a> on Wikipedia is good.
</li>
<li>
To find the radius of convergence of <span
class="math display">\[\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{(-2)^n}{\sqrt{n}}
x^n,\]</span> we need to compute <span class="math inline">\(\limsup_{n
\to \infty} \sqrt[n]{|(-2)^n/\sqrt{n}|}\)</span>. We have <span
class="math display">\[\sqrt[n]{\left|\frac{(-2)^n}{\sqrt{n}}\right|} =
(2^n)^{1/n} (n^{-1/2})^{1/n} = 2n^{-1/(2n)}.\]</span> Since <span
class="math inline">\(x^{-1/(2x)}\)</span> is strictly increasing for
<span class="math inline">\(x \gg 0\)</span>, its <span
class="math inline">\(\limsup\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(x
\to \infty\)</span> equals its usual limit as <span
class="math inline">\(x \to \infty\)</span>. Ultimately, <span
class="math inline">\(\limsup_{n \to \infty} 2n^{-1/(2n)} = 2\)</span>,
so the radius of convergence is <span
class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span>. What happens when <span
class="math inline">\(x = 1/2\)</span>? When <span
class="math inline">\(x = -1/2\)</span>?
</li>
<li>
<i>Extra:</i> To show that the harmonic series diverges: <span
class="math display">\[1 + \frac{1}{2} + \left(\frac{1}{3} +
\frac{1}{4}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{7} +
\frac{1}{8}\right) + \cdots \leq 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} +
\frac{1}{2} + \cdots\]</span> This trick is due to the 14th-century monk
Nicolas Oresme.
</li>
<li>
<i>Extra:</i> Another use of the notation <span
class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span> is the celebrated asymptotic <span
class="math display">\[\#\{\text{prime numbers $\leq x$}\} \sim
\frac{x}{\ln x},\]</span> also known as the prime number theorem.

Discuss convergence/divergence of improper integrals. We can use
approximation formulas to determine whether an integral converges or
diverges, then use the “<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-test”
and/or comparison tests if we want to prove our answer rigorously.
</li>
<li>
To study the convergence of the integral <span
class="math display">\[\int_1^\infty \frac{(x^3 + 3x + 2)^{1/2}}{(x^8 +
1)^{1/3}}\,dx,\]</span> we observe that when <span
class="math inline">\(x \gg 0\)</span> (meaning: <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is large), <span
class="math display">\[\frac{(x^3 + 3x + 2)^{1/2}}{(x^8 + 1)^{1/3}}
\approx \frac{(x^3)^{1/2}}{(x^8)^{1/3}}
= x^{3/2 - 8/3} = x^{-7/6}.\]</span> The <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-test says that <span
class="math display">\[
\int_1^\infty x^{-p}\,dx =
\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
\text{converges} &amp;p &gt; 1\\
\text{diverges} &amp;p \leq 1
\end{array}\right.
\]</span> Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(\int_1^\infty
x^{-7/6}\,dx\)</span> <u>converges</u>, which in turn shows that our
original integral converges.
</li>
<li>
If we wanted to prove the convergence above more rigorously, we might
use the following known comparisons for <span class="math inline">\(x
\gg 0\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\frac{(x^3 + 3x +
2)^{1/2}}{(x^8 + 1)^{1/3}} \leq \frac{(x^3 + 3x + 2)^{1/2}}{x^{8/3}}
\leq \frac{(x^3 + x^3 + x^3)^{1/2}}{x^{8/3}} = \frac{3^{1/2}
x^{3/2}}{x^{8/3}}.\]</span> Note that the constant <span
class="math inline">\(3^{1/2}\)</span> isn’t so important. Only the
exponent is important, since we want to use the <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-test.
</li>
<li>
To study the convergence of the integral <span
class="math display">\[\int_1^\infty (1 -
\cos(\tfrac{1}{x}))\,dx,\]</span> we note that <span
class="math inline">\(1/x \to 0^+\)</span> as <span
class="math inline">\(x \to \infty\)</span>, and therefore we can use
the approximation <span
class="math display">\[\cos\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) \approx 1 -
\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{2x^2}.\]</span> So
the original integral is approximated by <span
class="math inline">\(\int_1^\infty (1/(2x^2))\,dx\)</span>, which again
<u>converges</u> by the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-test. I
think that proving convergence rigorously (using some comparison test)
is a bit trickier in this example.
</li>
<li>
To study <span class="math display">\[\int_0^1 (\ln x)^2\,dx,\]</span>
it’s helpful to graph the integrand <span class="math inline">\((\ln
x)^2\)</span>. In the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-interval
<span class="math inline">\([0, 1]\)</span>, it is nonnegative and blows
up to infinity as <span class="math inline">\(x \to 0^+\)</span>. I find
it helpful to recast the area in question as an integral in <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, rather than an integral in <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. In the <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-interval <span
class="math inline">\([0, 1]\)</span>, we have <span
class="math display">\[y = (\ln x)^2 \iff x = e^{-\sqrt{y}}\]</span>
(why do we need a negative sign?), so the original integral equals <span
class="math display">\[\int_0^\infty e^{-\sqrt{y}}\,dy.\]</span> This is
essentially exponential decay, so it converges.
</li>
<li>
In more detail, you can do a “reverse <span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span>-substitution”: If <span
class="math inline">\(y = u^2\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(dy = 2u\,du\)</span>, so <span
class="math display">\[\int_{y = 0}^{y = \infty} e^{-\sqrt{y}}\,dy =
\int_{u = 0}^{u = \infty} 2u e^{-u}\,du.\]</span> The <span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span>-integral converges because, for
instance, <span class="math inline">\(2u e^{-u} \leq 2u(u^{-100}) =
2u^{-99}\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(u \gg 0\)</span>.

<ul>
<li>
We can use partial fraction decomposition to solve integrals like <span
class="math display">\[\int \frac{4x - 3}{x^2 - x - 6}\,dx.\]</span>
Factor the denominator: <span class="math inline">\(x^2 - x - 6 = (x -
3)(x + 2)\)</span>. Since the factors are distinct, the decomposition
looks like <span class="math display">\[\frac{4x - 3}{x^2 - x - 6} =
\frac{A}{x - 3} + \frac{B}{x + 2}\]</span> for some constants <span
class="math inline">\(A, B\)</span>. After clearing denominators on both
sides, and grouping together terms with the same exponents, we get the
pair of linear equations <span
class="math display">\[\left\{\begin{array}{rl}
4 &amp;= A + B\\
-3 &amp;= 2A - 3B
\end{array}\right.\]</span> which together determine a unique solution.
</li>
<li>
If there are repeated factors,then the decomposition has more terms:
<span class="math display">\[\frac{4}{(x + 1)(x - 1)^2} = \frac{A}{x +
1} + \frac{B_1}{x - 1} + \frac{B_2}{(x - 1)^2}.\]</span> If one of the
factors in the denominator is quadratic, then the corresponding term in
the decomposition has a linear numerator: <span
class="math display">\[\frac{4x - 3}{(x + 1)(x^2 + x + 1)} = \frac{A}{x
+ 1} + \frac{Bx + C}{x^2 + x + 1}\]</span> If the numerator is of higher
degree than the denominator, then use long division to simplify it:
<span class="math display">\[\frac{x^3 - x^2 + 1}{x^2 - x - 6} =
\frac{x(x^2 - x - 6) + (6x + 1)}{x^2 - x - 6} = x + \frac{6x + 1}{x^2 -
x - 6}.\]</span> We know that <span class="math inline">\(6x +
1\)</span> is the final remainder of the long division because it’s of
lower degree than the divisor <span class="math inline">\(x^2 - x -
6\)</span>.
</li>
<li>
A one-line proof of the integration-by-parts formula: Observe that <span
class="math display">\[uv = \int d(uv) = \int u\,dv + \int
v\,du,\]</span> and rearrange the terms.
</li>
<li>
Sometimes, we need to integrate by parts multiple times. A standard
example is <span class="math display">\[\int_0^{\pi/2} x^2\cos
x\,dx.\]</span> Take <span class="math inline">\(u = x^2\)</span> the
first time, and take <span class="math inline">\(u = x\)</span> the
second time.
</li>
<li>
A trickier example is <span class="math inline">\(\int e^x \sin
x\,dx\)</span>. After integrating by parts twice, we end up with <span
class="math display">\[\int_a^b e^x \sin x\,dx = (e^x \sin x - e^x \cos
x)|_a^b - \int_a^b e^x \sin x\,dx.\]</span> We got back the original
integral we wanted to solve. But we can group together these two copies
of the integral! Doing so, we arrive at <span
class="math display">\[\int_a^b e^x \sin x\,dx = \frac{1}{2}(e^x \sin x
- e^x \cos x)|_a^b.\]</span> The moral is that sometimes you get
infinitely repeating patterns of integrands, and you can break out of
them by doing algebra instead of calculus.

<i>Extra:</i> Suppose I have cows and chickens, there are <span

many chickens do I have? You might solve this with a pair of linear
equations. Alternatively, you might note that <span
class="math inline">\(14\)</span> chickens is definitely too few legs,
and each time we trade a chicken for a cow, the leg-count goes up by
<span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>.

Review limits that can be evaluated by interpretation as Riemann sums.
Given <span class="math display">\[\lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{k = 1}^n
\frac{1}{n + k},\]</span> we want to write the expression being summed
in terms of <span class="math inline">\(f(k/n)\)</span> (for some

\frac{1}{n}\]</span> suggests taking <span class="math inline">\(f(x) =

In the method of shells, the axis of rotation and the axis of
integration are perpendicular to one another. In the method of
disks/washers, they are the same.
</li>
<li>
Draw a region in the <span class="math inline">\(xy\)</span>-plane such
that, if we rotated it about the <span

the volume using shells than using disks/washers. Repeat this exercise
with the relative difficulty levels reversed.
</li>
<li>
Use either shells or disks/washers to solve the following problem (or
both, and decide which was easier): A hole is drilled vertically through
the center of a solid sphere, leaving a “spherical ring”. Suppose the
sphere has radius <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and the ring
has height <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>. Show that the volume
of the ring depends on <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> but not on
<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.

Discuss problem 2(b) from problem set 2. In general, when a question
asks for an approximate or asymptotic formula, the answer should keep
the (important) variables from the thing we’re approximating. In this
particular case, we need to find an asymptotic for <span
class="math inline">\(\ln((j + 1)/j)\)</span> when the integer <span
class="math inline">\(j\)</span> is large. We expand <span
class="math display">\[\ln \left(\frac{j + 1}{j}\right) = \ln(1 +
j^{-1}) = j^{-1} + O(j^{-2}).\]</span> Although it is true that the last
expression tends to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> as <span
class="math inline">\(j \to +\infty\)</span>, the problem is asking for
the (linear) <i>asymptotic</i>, not the <i>limit</i>. So the answer is
the linear term <span class="math inline">\(j^{-1}\)</span>, not <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span>.
</li>
<li>
You need trigonometric substitution (trig sub) when your integrand has a
quadratic term like <span class="math inline">\(x^2 \pm a^2\)</span>,
but substituting <span class="math inline">\(u = x^2 \pm a^2\)</span>
doesn’t work.
<ol>
<li>
<b>Good:</b> The integral <span class="math display">\[\int
\frac{2x\,dx}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}}\]</span> can be solved with <span
class="math inline">\(u = 1 + x^2\)</span>. No trig sub is required.
</li>
<li>
<b>Bad:</b> To solve the integral <span class="math display">\[\int
\frac{dx}{(1 + x^2)^2},\]</span> we observe that <span
class="math inline">\(1 + x^2\)</span> looks like the left-hand side of
<span class="math inline">\(1 + \tan^2 \theta = \sec^2 \theta\)</span>.
That suggests the substitution <span class="math inline">\(x = \tan
\theta\)</span>. In the end you get <span class="math inline">\(\int
\cos^2 \theta\,d\theta\)</span>, which can be solved with the identity
<span class="math inline">\(\cos^2 \theta = \frac{1}{2}(1 +
\cos(2\theta))\)</span>.
</li>
<li>
<b>Ugly:</b> To solve the integral <span class="math display">\[\int
\frac{\sqrt{x^2 - a^2}}{x^2}\,dx,\]</span> we observe that <span
class="math inline">\(x^2 - a^2\)</span> looks like the left-hand side
of <span class="math inline">\(\sec^2 \theta - 1 = \tan^2
\theta\)</span>. That suggests <span class="math inline">\(x = a\sec
\theta\)</span>. In the end you get <span class="math inline">\(\int
((\sin^2 \theta)/\cos \theta)\,d\theta\)</span> (up to sign). You can
simplify the integrand to <span class="math inline">\(\sec \theta - \cos
\theta\)</span>, then look up the antiderivative of <span
class="math inline">\(\sec \theta\)</span>.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
In general, I like to do trig sub using the <span
class="math inline">\(\sec\)</span>/<span
class="math inline">\(\tan\)</span> identities above. When there are
bounds of integration, the substitution will result in bounds that
involve <span class="math inline">\(\text{arcsec}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\arctan\)</span>.
</li>
<li>
The equation <span class="math inline">\(x^2/a^2 + y^2/b^2 = 1\)</span>
describes an ellipse with <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-radius
<span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-radius <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. If we rotate the piece where <span
class="math inline">\(x \geq 0\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y \geq 0\)</span> about the <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-axis, what is the volume of the
resulting half-ellipsoid? You should get <span
class="math inline">\((2/3)\pi a^2b\)</span>.
</li>
<li>
But we can do the ellipsoid problem by “pure thought”! We know that the
volume of a unit hemisphere equals <span
class="math inline">\((2/3)\pi\)</span>. The half-ellipsoid in the
problem is a unit hemisphere that we’ve stretched uniformly by a factor
of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> along the <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>- and <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-axes, and by a factor of <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> along the <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-axis. That’s why we get two factors of
<span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and one factor of <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> in the answer above.

<li>
What can we say about the graph of <span class="math display">\[F(x) =
\int_0^x (1 + t^2)^{-3/2}\,dt?\]</span> By the Fundamental Theorem of
Calculus, <span class="math display">\[F&#39;(x) = (1 +
x^2)^{-3/2}.\]</span> That’s already enough to tell us (1) whether <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is even or odd or neither; (2) whether
<span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is increasing or decreasing or
neither; (3) where <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is concave or
convex.

<li>
Consider the curve where <span class="math inline">\(y = x^2\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(x \geq 0\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(1 \leq y \leq 4\)</span>. What’s the area of the
surface formed by rotating this curve about the <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-axis? Slice the desired surface into
cylinders of radius <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and
infinitesimal height <span class="math inline">\(ds = \sqrt{(dx)^2 +
(dy)^2}\)</span>. Such a cylinder has area <span
class="math inline">\(2\pi x\,ds.\)</span> Since <span
class="math inline">\(y = x^2\)</span>, we get <span
class="math inline">\(dy = 2x\,dx\)</span>, whence <span
class="math display">\[ds = \sqrt{1 + 4x^2}\,dx.\]</span> Finally, the
<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-interval <span
class="math inline">\([1, 4]\)</span> corresponds to the <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-interval <span
class="math inline">\([1, 2]\)</span>, so we arrive at <span
class="math display">\[\int_1^2 2\pi x \sqrt{1 + 4x^2}\,dx\]</span> The
rest is the reverse chain rule.

The method of shells relies on knowing the volume of a cylindrical shell
of height <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>, radius <span

class="math display">\[V_\text{cyl} = 2\pi rh\,dr.\]</span> In this
method, you slice the graph <i>parallel</i> to the axis of rotation.
</li>
<li>
The method of disks/washers relies on knowing the volume of a washer of
outer radius <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, inner radius <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, and infinitesimal thickness <span
class="math inline">\(dh\)</span>: <span
class="math display">\[V_\text{wash} = \pi (R^2 - r^2)\,dh.\]</span> In
this method, you slice <i>perpendicular</i> to the axis of rotation.

<li>
Discuss how work equals force times distance: <span
class="math display">\[dW = F(x)\,dx.\]</span> Since force is mass times
acceleration, force has units of <span class="math inline">\(\text{kg}
\cdot \text{m/s$^2$}\)</span> and work has units of <span
class="math inline">\(\text{kg} \cdot \text{m$^2$/s$^2$} =
\text{J}\)</span> (joules). For example: Gravity is an inverse square
law <span class="math inline">\(F(x) = GMm/x^2\)</span>. The work
required to lift a rocket from height <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> above the Earth’s center to height
<span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is <span class="math display">\[W
= \int_r^R \frac{GMm}{x^2}\,dx = GMm\left(\frac{1}{r} -
\frac{1}{R}\right).\]</span> As <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>
gets large, this expression tends to <span
class="math inline">\(GMm/r\)</span>, a finite amount of energy.
Therefore, rockets only need finite energy to escape the Earth’s pull.

Discuss problem 1(b) from problem set 1. We’re asked to find the
smallest <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> such that if <span
class="math inline">\(x \geq b\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(x^3/(e^x - 1) = (1 \pm 0.05)x^3 e^{-x}.\)</span>
It’s possible to find an exact answer, but the problem asks us to solve
it by finding an approximation to <span
class="math display">\[\frac{x^3}{e^x - 1} - x^3 e^{-x}\]</span> for
large <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. There are two key ideas:
<ol>
<li>
Approximating something when <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is
large, <i>i.e.</i>, when <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is near
<span class="math inline">\(+\infty\)</span>, is equivalent to
approximating it when <span class="math inline">\(x^{-1}\)</span> is
near <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> (and positive).
</li>
<li>
If a function in <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> has exponential
decay, then its Taylor expansion at <span
class="math inline">\(+\infty\)</span> is just zero, which gives no
information; in that case it is better to work with the variable <span
class="math inline">\(u = e^x\)</span> than the variable <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.
</li>
</ol>
Ultimately, we’re led to rewrite some expression in <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> as an expression in <span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span>, then rewrite that as an expression in
<span class="math inline">\(u^{-1}\)</span>: <span
class="math display">\[\begin{align}
\frac{1}{e^x - 1}
= \frac{1}{u - 1}
= \frac{u^{-1}}{1 - u^{-1}}
= u^{-1}(1 + u^{-1} + O(u^{-2})).
\end{align}\]</span> Above, the last step is linear approximation for
<span class="math inline">\(u^{-1}\)</span> near <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span>. After re-substituting, we get <span
class="math display">\[\frac{1}{e^x - 1} = e^{-x}(1 + e^{-x} +
O(e^{-2x})),\]</span> which yields the estimate <span
class="math display">\[\frac{x^3}{e^x - 1} - x^3 e^{-x} \approx
x^3e^{-2x}.\]</span> The problem can be finished from there.
</li>
<li>
A Riemann integral is a limit of the form <span
class="math display">\[\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = \lim_{\max_i |\Delta_i| \to
0} \sum_i f(x_i)\Delta_i.\]</span> Here, the sum on a fixed partition of
the interval <span class="math inline">\([a, b]\)</span> into finitely
many subintervals: <span class="math inline">\(a = x_0 &lt; x_1 &lt;
\cdots &lt; x_n = b\)</span>. (The sum runs from <span
class="math inline">\(i = 1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(i =
n\)</span>.) We use the notation <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_i =
x_i - x_{i - 1}\)</span>, so that <span
class="math inline">\(f(x_i)\Delta_i\)</span> is the signed area of a
rectangle with base <span class="math inline">\([x_{i - 1},
x_i]\)</span>. The limit runs over all possible partitions.
</li>
<li>
Technically, the sum in the definition above is a <i>right-hand</i>
Riemann sum. In the <i>left-hand</i> version, we replace <span
class="math inline">\(f(x_i)\)</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(f(x_{i - 1})\)</span>. The function is said to be
<i>Riemann integrable</i> if and only if the limits of both Riemann sums
exist and equal each other.
</li>
<li>
Conversely, if we know how to compute integrals, then we can use them to
compute certain limits. For instance, <span
class="math display">\[\lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{k = 1}^n
\frac{k^2}{n^3}\]</span> can be viewed as the limit that defines the
integral <span class="math inline">\(\int_0^1 x^2\,dx\)</span>, so its
value is <span class="math inline">\((x^3/3)|_{x = 0}^{x = 1} =
1/3\)</span>. To do these problems in general, we want to write the
expression being summed as <span
class="math inline">\(f(x_k)\Delta_k\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta_k \to 0\)</span> as <span
class="math inline">\(n \to \infty\)</span>. Usually the rectangles all
have the same width, <i>i.e.</i>, <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta_k\)</span> is the same for all <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. In the present example, <span
class="math inline">\(x_k = k/n\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta_k = 1/n\)</span>.
</li>
<li>
The main technique to compute integrals is what I call the “reverse
chain rule” (sometimes known as “<span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span>-substitution”). For instance, suppose
<span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is a positive constant and we
want to compute <span class="math display">\[\int_{2a}^{3a} \frac{x}{x^2
- a^2}\,dx.\]</span> The complicated part is the denominator. Since
<span class="math inline">\(\ln u\)</span> is the antiderivative of
<span class="math inline">\(1/u\)</span> (with respect to <span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span>), we’re led to consider <span
class="math inline">\(\ln(x^2 - a^2)\)</span>. The derivative of this
expression differs from the actual integrand by a factor of <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, so we have to multiply the expression
by <span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span>. So the original integral
equals <span class="math display">\[\left.\left[\frac{1}{2}\,\ln(x^2 -
a^2)\right]\right|_{x = 2a}^{3a} = \frac{1}{2}\,\ln(8a^2) -
\frac{1}{2}\,\ln(3a^2) = \frac{1}{2}\,\ln\frac{8}{3}.\]</span>
Interestingly, this value is independent of <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span>.

Discuss big-<span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> notation and the

f(x)g(x) &amp;= (a_0b_0) + (a_0b_1 + a_1b_0)x + O(x^2).
\end{align}\]</span> In general, if you form a sum, product, <i>etc.</i>
of big-<span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> expressions, then the
error term of the result is the <i>coarsest</i> error term among the
original expressions.
</li>
<li>
Why care about the above? When approximating something messy like <span

easier to approximate the individual pieces first, then multiply them

<li>
L’Hôpital’s rule can be proven using linear approximation. Sometimes,
approximation is faster than l’Hôpital itself. For instance, <span

class="math inline">\(\ln x\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\sin
x\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\cos x\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\tan x\)</span>. Do <span
class="math inline">\(\cot x\)</span> as an exercise.

Review the sum rule, the product rule, the quotient rule, and the chain
rule. My mnemonic for the quotient rule is “ho-de-hi minus hi-de-ho over
hoho”: <span class="math display">\[D\left(\frac{ho}{hi}\right) =
\frac{ho\,D(hi) - hi\,D(ho)}{(ho)^2},\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(ho\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(hi\)</span> are functions (say, of <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>) and <span class="math inline">\(D =
d/dx\)</span>.

Find the derivative of <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = x^x\)</span>.
One approach is to take logarithms of both sides to get <span
class="math inline">\(\ln f(x) = x\ln x\)</span>, then differentiate
both sides, then solve for <span
class="math inline">\(f&#39;(x)\)</span>. Main point: It’s easier to
work with <span class="math inline">\(\ln f(x)\)</span> than <span
class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> directly.
</li>
<li>
What is <span class="math inline">\(\lim_{x \to 0^+} x^x\)</span>? As
before, set <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = x^x\)</span>. We can show
that <span class="math inline">\(\ln f(x) \to 0\)</span>, then deduce
that <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = e^{\ln f(x)} \to e^0 =
1\)</span>.
